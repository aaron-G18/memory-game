# Clicky-Memory-Game

This app is a memory game where the user will choose a theme for the game, and then continue to click on the tiles to get points. Each tile can only be clicked once and the tiles will be shuffled each time the user clicks one. If a tile is clicked twice, an alert will say that the tile was already clicked, and restart the game. The user's high score will be recorded and tracked (for that session).
